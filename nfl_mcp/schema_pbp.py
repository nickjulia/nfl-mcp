QUERY TIPS
  • Boolean outcome columns are DOUBLE PRECISION 0/1 — filter with `= 1` not `IS TRUE`
  • play_type is lowercase: 'pass', 'run', 'field_goal' — not uppercase
  • Player names are abbreviated: 'P.Mahomes', 'T.Hill', 'D.Henry', 'J.Jefferson'
  • Use aggregate tables for season-level team stats (much faster than raw plays)
  • Use plays table directly for play-level filtering or custom aggregations
  • Use ILIKE '%keyword%' for text search in the desc column
  • Exclude non-play rows: WHERE play_type NOT IN ('no_play','qb_spike','qb_kneel')
    or WHERE rush_attempt = 1 OR pass_attempt = 1
  • Exclude special teams: WHERE special_teams_play = 0 OR special_teams_play IS NULL
  • For REG season only: WHERE season_type = 'REG'
  • game_date is TEXT in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format — cast if needed: game_date::date
  • `success` = 1 means play met the success threshold (50%+ of yards on 1st, 70%+ on 2nd, 100% on 3rd/4th)
  • OT is qtr = 5
